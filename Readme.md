# Double Pendulum Visualizer

Simple visualization of the chaotic dynamics of a double pendulum.

The simulation uses the laws of physics to determine the location of both the bobs of the pendulum at a given time.

The trajectory followed by the bob depends heavily on the initial conditions. A slight variation in the intital conditions would result in exponential difference in the positions over time.
